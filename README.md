# another_manga_downloader 2

I know, here is another python script to download mangas from the internet.. well, this one is small sized, and fast.

## installation

Requires Python >= 3.10.

Install curses for printing on terminal
```
pip install uni-curses
```
download the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/ttoommxx/another_manga_downloader
```

## usage

Run `python another_manga_downloader.py` and search for the manga to download.

Alternatively, run `python another_manga_downloader.py -u` followed by the URLS of the Mangas you want to download.

Finally, if you cannot install `pip` and/or `uni-curses`, I compiled a version for Linux x64 using `pyinstaller`.
